# CS-250-Module-Eight-Journal
While​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ working on a software program, I came to understand that knowing what the users really want is the most vital part of the whole process. It is not only about coding but more about discovering what people want the software to do for them and how you can make their lives easier. User stories are a great way for that because they explain in a very simple and clear manner the expectations of the user. Writing user stories was the thing that kept me focused on the development of the SNHU Travel features during the SNHU Travel project, and I really got a lot out of it. The thing that also stands out to me is how, through this process, the communication between the Product Owner and developers, you get to understand that everyone is aligned and working towards one common goal.

Agile methods are my preferred way of working when I get a new assignment. It is a fact that Daily Scrum type regular meetings and post-sprint reflection make the team more orderly and give room for continual improvement. These practices are ones that I want to always keep using because they are a great support in building teamwork, being flexible and continuous learning. Being a good team member, in my opinion, comprises of clear communication, giving others support, and taking up the responsibility of one's work. I have learned through this course that excellent software is not the brainchild of a single person but rather a team that listens, collaborates, and grows ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌together.
